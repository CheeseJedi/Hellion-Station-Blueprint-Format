# Hellion-Station-Blueprint-Format
A community proposal for a JSON based file format for the interchange of Hellion station blueprints.

This proposal aims to set out a minimal JSON data format to describe the docking hierarchy of ships and modules within the game HELLION by Zero Gravity Games and allow such descriptions to be created or consumed by community tools.

It is not a data export format for HELLION Dedicated Server .save files as it does not describe the condition, inventory or any other state of any of the modules beyond 1 a record of what the module type is and 2 which ports are docked to another module, and the ports that are in use.
